-Another Strategy-
Sometimes, Website blocking services block port 88, which is commonly known as "HTTP", A simple yet
effective bypass can occur if you add an s at the end, making it "HTTPS" which would make it switch
to port 443.

-Another strategy-
Go to Google Translate page. Choose a source language that you do not speak, here it’s “Spanish”.
Choose the destination language as the one you speak, here it’s English.
Enter the URL of the website you want to access in the source and then wait for it to translate it.
