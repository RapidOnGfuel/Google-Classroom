So basically you need to import the bookmark into the bookmark tab, its not super difficult
Click on the 3 dots (settings) 
Click on bookmarks
Click on bookmark manager
Click on the 3 dots inside the blue bar
Click import bookmarks
Double click on the file you downloaded from here
Then you should have a bookmark titled "Imported" or something
Load up a google snake game, and then click the folder, then click the moremenue.html thing, and the menu should pop up
Make sure you die once before clicking the bookmark, and make sure you are not in the customization menu as you do it,
You should be on the death screen, not the screen when you click on the cogwheel.
